Description: {standard} provices a more simplified interface to the linear 
  models system in R for the fitting of standard curves and their usage in 
  biochemistry and molecular biology. While R Provides a robust ecosystem for 
  modelling, this remains overwhelming for the majority of wet-lab scientists 
  and contains unnecessary amounts of complexity. `{standard}` provides a 
  streamlined experience of this, enabling simplified fitting of stndard curves,
  and calculation of unknown values.
